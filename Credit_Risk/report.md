## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
        The purpose of this analysis was to determine if the Logistic Regression learning model performed was capable of accurately predicting healthy loans and high risk loans, using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending  services company. 

* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
        The financial information was on 77,535 different loan accounts. I needed to predict the loan status and risk of the accounts. Information used to calculate this included: 'loan_size', 'interest_rate', 'borrower_income', 'debt_to_income', 'num_of_accounts', 'derogatory_marks', 'total_debt', and 'loan_status'.

* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
        Stage 1: Read in and gather a brief overview of the data
        Stage 2: Create labels and features from the columns in the dataset.
        Stage 3: Split the data into training and testign datasets (using 'train_test_split').
        Stage 4: Create a Logistic Regression Model with the original data.
        Stage 5: Analyse the predicitions generated by the Logistic Regression Model.

* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).
    LogisticRegression, train_test_split, confusion_matrix, classification_report, all from sklearn, as well as numpy, pandas, and pathlib were used to coduct this challenge.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    - Accuracy score: 0.99
    - Precision score:
        Class 0: 1.00
        Class 1: 0.84
    Recall score: 
        Class 0: 0.99
        Class 1: 0.94

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.

        The model has a high accuracy rating, and is able to predict healthy loans to perfection, while being able to predict high risk loans very well, but not perfectly.

        With an accuracy score of 0.99, I would suggest that this model could be used by large companies depending on their goal. If the company finds accurately predicting high risk loans to be the most important aspect, then I would suggest further training. However, if they find equal value in the prediction of healthy loans and high risk loans, then they may find much success with this model. For those concerned only with healthy loans, then I would highly suggest the use of this model.
